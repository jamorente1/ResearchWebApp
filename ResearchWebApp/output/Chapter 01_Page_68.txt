Security as a Social Science

+ Social science examines the behavior of individuals
interacting with systems.

Â« Security begins and ends with the people that
interact with the system, intentionally or otherwise.

+ Security administrators can greatly reduce the
levels of risk caused by end users and create more
acceptable and supportable security profiles.
