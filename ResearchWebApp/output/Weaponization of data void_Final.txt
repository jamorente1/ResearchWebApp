WHAT IS DATA VOID?

 

Data voids are one such way that search users can be led into disinformation
or manipulated content. These voids occur when obscure search queries have
few results associated with them, making them ripe for exploitation by media
manipulators with ideological, economic, or political agendas. (Golebiewski
& Boyd, 2019)

 

e It is a lack of readily available, credible, authoritative information
relating to a specific topic

¢ Data voids are often difficult to detect.

e Data voids are compounded by the fraught pathways of search-

adjacent recommendation systems such as auto-play, auto-fill, and

trending topics; each of which are vulnerable to manipulation.
