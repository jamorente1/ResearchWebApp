Figure 1-1 The Enigma (2 of 2)

 

Â« Earlier versions of the German code machine Enigma were
first broken by the Poles in the 1930s. The British and
Americans managed to break later, more complex versions
during World War Il. The increasingly complex versions of
the Enigma, especially the submarine or Unterseeboot
version of the Enigma, caused considerable anguish to Allied
forces before finally being cracked. The information gained
from decrypted transmissions was used to anticipate the
actions of German armed forces. 'Some ask why, if we were
reading the Enigma, we did not win the war earlier. One
might ask, instead, when, if ever, we would have won the
war if we hadn't read it'
