<h2>What is Data Void?</h2>
<p>Data voids are a phenomenon where search users encounter disinformation or manipulated content due to a lack of credible, authoritative information on a specific topic.

<ul>
  <li>The lack of readily available information</li>
  <li>The difficulty of detection</li>
  <li>The vulnerability of search-adjacent recommendation systems such as auto-play, auto-fill, and trending topics to manipulation</li>
</ul>
